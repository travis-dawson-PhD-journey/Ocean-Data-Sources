The data has been calibrated against NDBC buoy data and validated with independent buoy measurements and at cross-over points with other altimeter missions. The long term stability of the data has been assessed against buoy data and any discontinuities which may occur due to changes in the processing techniques or instrumentation has been removed in the calibration process.
